# Welcome to LosetheLeftovers! 

LosetheLeftOvers is a food-sharing app made for a client that I worked on with my Capstone group. 

This software is segragated into two distinct pieces, the frontend and the backend.

The [frontend](/app/LooseTheLeftovers_Frontend) is a React-Native mobile app implementation using TypeScript. The [backend](/app/LooseTheLeftovers_Backend) is segragated into several microservices to ensure scalability and a high volume of requests. This app is also secure, using JWT access tokens with refresh tokens for private end points. Code-reusablility and Test Driven Development was our design philosiphy. 

Here is a brief overview of this app's features: 
  - Instant Messaging
  - Profile creation
  - Feed of user posted 'ads' with Lazy Loading
  - Ability to sort by location using GIS
  - Password reset
  - Edit/Delete profile
  - Edit/Delete ads
